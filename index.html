    <h2 id="history-text">Historical background of the city</h2>
    <p id="history-text1">
      Although the Split area was earlier inhabited by the Greek colonies,
      Emperor Diocletian should be considered its first citizen and founder,
      starting his lavish villa of around 300 square meters near the great city
      of Salona in 293 AD, only to retire from the Roman throne within its walls
      after building it for ten years. Turbulent centuries that followed turned
      the villa into a city, conceived by the fugitive inhabitants of Salona who
      fled from the Avars and Slavs. Many authorities changed hands in the city
      which, in the years to come, grew beyond the Palace walls, from the
      Croatian Kings in the 10th century, through the Hungarian and Venetian
      administration, to the French rulers and the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.
      Modern age and the 20th century "moved" Split from the kingdom of
      Yugoslavia, through tragic, yet heroic times of the Italian and German
      occupation during the Second World War when Split was one of the centres
      of anti-fascist resistance, to the Socialist Yugoslavia and the present
      period of the free and independent Croatia, member of the European Union.
